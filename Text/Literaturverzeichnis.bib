@article{Brodie.2012,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To delineate the temporal patterns of outcome and to determine the probability of seizure freedom with successive antiepileptic drug regimens in newly diagnosed epilepsy.

METHODS

Patients in whom epilepsy was diagnosed and the first antiepileptic drug prescribed between July 1, 1982, and April 1, 2006, were followed up until March 31, 2008. Outcomes were categorized into 4 patterns: (A) early and sustained seizure freedom; (B) delayed but sustained seizure freedom; (C) fluctuation between periods of seizure freedom and relapse; and (D) seizure freedom never attained. Probability of seizure freedom with successive drug regimens was compared. Seizure freedom was defined as no seizures for $\geq$1 year.

RESULTS

A total of 1,098 patients were included (median age 32 years, range 9-93). At the last clinic visit, 749 (68{\%}) patients were seizure-free, 678 (62{\%}) on monotherapy. Outcome pattern A was observed in 408 (37{\%}), pattern B in 246 (22{\%}), pattern C in 172 (16{\%}), and pattern D in 272 (25{\%}) patients. There was a higher probability of seizure freedom in patients receiving 1 compared to 2 drug regimens, and 2 compared to 3 regimens (p {\textless} 0.001). The difference was greater among patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic than with idiopathic epilepsy. Less than 2{\%} of patients became seizure-free on subsequent regimens but a few did so on their sixth or seventh regimen.

CONCLUSIONS

Most patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy had a constant course which could usually be predicted early. The chance of seizure freedom declined with successive drug regimens, most markedly from the first to the third and among patients with localization-related epilepsies.},

@article{Eadie.2012,
 abstract = {On 12 May 1857, Edward Sieveking read a paper on epilepsy to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in London. During the discussion that followed Sir Charles Locock, obstetrician to Queen Victoria, was reported to have commented that during the past 14 months he had used potassium bromide to successfully stop epileptic seizures in all but one of 14 or 15 women with 'hysterical' or catamenial epilepsy. This report of Locock's comment has generally given him credit for introducing the first reasonably effective antiepileptic drug into medical practice. However examination of the original reports raises questions as to how soundly based the accounts of Locock's comments were. Subsequently, others using the drug to treat epilepsy failed to obtain the degree of benefit that the reports of Locock's comments would have led them to expect. The drug might not have come into more widespread use as a result, had not Samuel Wilks provided good, independent evidence for the drug's antiepileptic efficacy in 1861.},

@article{Ernst.1988,
 abstract = {Thirty-six children with epilepsy resistant to conventional treatment were treated with bromides in addition to the current therapy. Six out of 19 cases with prevailingly or exclusively generalized tonic-clonic seizures became seizure-free and in 9 cases a reduction in seizure frequency of more than 50{\%} was achieved. Freedom from seizures could not be obtained in 13 cases, who had frequent minor seizures in addition to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In some, minor seizures were even activated. Tonic and focal seizures showed no response. Side effects were observed in one-third of the cases (acne, loss of appetite, loss of weight, fatigue) but in no case they did become intolerable. Fifty to 80 mg potassium bromide per kg body weight seems to be an effective daily dose range. There is a preferential indication of bromides for patients suffering from early onset epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or alternating hemigrand mal, for whom other treatment is ineffective. This disorder is characterized by a high familial incidence of epileptic seizures, onset between 6 months and 3 years of age, normal development until the onset of seizures, generalized tonicclonic seizures and often alternating hemi-grand mal, seizure precipitation by fever, and occasional combination with or transition to myoclonic-astatic and/'or myoclonic seizures. EEG is often normal or shows slight slowing in the initial phase; later it shows theta rhythms and generalized spikes and waves. Especially, if the onset is during the first year of life, the course of the epilepsy is often unfavourable. Key words: Epilepsy, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, therapy, bromides.},

 abstract = {Summary:  The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) have come to consensus definitions for the terms epileptic seizure and epilepsy. An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure.},

The newly-renamed Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP) has a refocused mission to identify novel agents which will help address the considerable remaining unmet medical needs in epilepsy. These include identifying antiseizure agents for treatment-resistant epilepsy, as well as anti-epileptogenic agents that will prevent the development of epilepsy or disease-modifying agents that will ameliorate or even cure established epilepsy and its comorbidities. This manuscript provides an overview of the ETSP's efforts aimed at identifying the next generation of therapeutic agents to further reduce the suffering from and burden of epilepsy.},
